Install Cypress and start the server:

1. Download Node.js from the website and unpack the MacOS packate and install.

2. Create a Cypress project folder and move to it. Create an optional project directory under that 
and move into that directory.

3. Run the following command which creates the package.json file:

	npm init -y

	Wrote to /Users/mhotchkiss/package.json:

	{
	  "name": "mhotchkiss",
	  "version": "1.0.0",
	  "description": "",
	  "main": "index.js",
	  "scripts": {
	    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	  },
	  "keywords": [],
	  "author": "",
	  "license": "ISC"
	}

3. Run the following command:

	npm install cypress

	npm notice New major version of npm available! 9.8.1 -> 10.1.0
	npm notice Changelog: https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v10.1.0

This creates the project file structure for the server and new code.
