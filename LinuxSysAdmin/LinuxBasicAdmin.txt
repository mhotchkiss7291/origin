Start and stop the cron daemon:

	# /etc/init.d/cron start
	 * Starting periodic command scheduler cron
	# ps -aux | grep cron
	root        27  0.0  0.0   3620  2036 ?        Ss   00:50   0:00 /usr/sbin/cron

Opens in vi, append something like this line that# displays a reminder

	0 16 1,15 * * echo Timesheets Due > /dev/console
	
Write and quit and /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root is created:

	# cat /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root

	# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - edit the master and reinstall.
	# (/tmp/crontab.vwJXSV/crontab installed on Sat Feb 26 00:21:31 2022)
	# (Cron version -- $Id: crontab.c,v 2.13 1994/01/17 03:20:37 vixie Exp $)
	# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
	#
	# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
	# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
	# and what command to run for the task
	#
	# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
	# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
	# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
	#
	# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
	# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
	#
	# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
	# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
	#
	# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
	# at 5 a.m every week with:
	# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
	#
	# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
	#
	# m h  dom mon dow   command
	0 16 1,15 * * echo Timesheets Due > /dev/console

For a normal user:

	crontab -l <username>
