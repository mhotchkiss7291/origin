Explain what the Linux kernel is in simple words.
	Interface between software applications and hardware, processor

Can you edit the Linux kernel?
	Yes, but it's not easy or recommended unless you really need it.

What are the advantages of Linux being open-source software?
	Community can contribute and find bugs. Non-proprietary

What is a process ID?
	For every task there is process ID that can be monitored using "top"
	or if you know the name of the application by its process name you can 
	use "ps -ef | grep myname", get the process ID then to kill, "kill -9 PID"

	fork, exec, exit, wait
	sleep, kill, 

Explain what makes Linux a secure operating system.
	The concept of a superuser and strict file permissions for execution only 
	by permitted users. Opensource management.

	grep is one of my most useful tools.
	Find a text string inside of a file in the entire filesystem below you:
	find . -type f | xargs grep -i "mystring"

Please elaborate on the effect of multiple desktop environments on a Linux system.
	It may not be a problem for some chosen desktops, but some conflicts 
	can happen with file conventions when two different desktops access
	the same filesystem one after the other. Best to stick with one or what 
	does not cause problems.

Set up new user:


Add new group to /etc/group, append 

	my_group:x:201:

Append to /etc/passwd with same group integer:

Run pwconv to generate /etc/shadow entry and user

	pwconv

Create new user home directory:

	# mkdir /home/my_user

Change ownership:

	 * Stopping periodic command scheduler cron

Schedule a cron job:

Generate a job for root

	# crontab -e root

Opens in vi, append something like this line that# displays a reminder 
in the user's console window at 4 p.m. on the first and fifteenth of every month.

	0 16 1,15 * * echo Timesheets Due > /dev/console
	
Write and quit and /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root is created:

	# (Cron version -- $Id: crontab.c,v 2.13 1994/01/17 03:20:37 vixie Exp $)
	# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
	#
	# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
	# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
	# and what command to run for the task
	#
	# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
	# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
	# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
	#
	# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
	# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
	#
	# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
	# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
	#
	# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
	# at 5 a.m every week with:
	# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/

Find what your DNS server is:

Release DHCP server and get a new lease:

	# Release
	sudo dhclient -v -r

/dev/sda9            3265        5283    16217586    b  W95 FAT32

To view all partitions of the /dev/sda hard disk, do the following.

	fdisk -l /dev/sda

Partition table scan:
	MBR:
	BSD: not present
...

	Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

	Command (? for help): d
	Partition number (1-2): 1

Use w to delete partitions....

	Command (? for help): w

	Final checks complete......Overwrite...PARTITIONS!!
	Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): Y

Ready to be partitioned.

	fdisk -l

	Disk identifier: XXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX

Create a GUID Partition Table (GPT)

	sudo gdisk /dev/sda

	? n    - New partition
	? 1    - Partiton number
	Continue if you want more partitions
	? w

	Do you want to proceed? Y

	fdisk -l

	You should see: Disklabel type: gpt

	Device	Start	End	Sectors	Size	Type
	/dev/sda1 2048	xxxxx   xxxxx           Linux filesystem

Create new filesystem:

	sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1   <--------- the partition just created

Prepare to mount the drive:

/etc/fstab lists all of the available disks, partitons, options on separate line.

	# device mounting_directory filesystem_type options dump fsck
	/dev/hdc /cdrom iso9660 rw,noauto,user 0 0

Get the UUID of the disk drive installed:

	sudo blkid     

	Find: UUID=ba15c3ca-06e2-4591-ba49-2230dc3ba3fa

Paste it into the /etc/fstab file

	UUID=ba15c3ca-06e2-4591-ba49-2230dc3ba3fa /mnt/my_mount_pt ext4 defaults 0 0 

Filesystem type: ext4, 0 0 (for whether you want to check on startup)

Create folders for the mount points:

	cd /mnt
	mkdir my_mount_pt

Actually mount the drives listed in the /etc/fstab file

	mount -a

List the disk drives and free space:

	df -h     - Human readable format

To make each of the individual partition be seen as a single file system install:

	apt-get mhddfs 

Edit the /etc/fstab and append this line to "fuse" the partitions

	mhddfs#/mnt/my_mount_pt,/mnt/my_mount_pt2 /mnt/my_system fuse allow_other,nonempty 0 0

Create the directory for mounting:

	cd /mnt
	mkdir my_system

Repeat mount using /etc/fstab to fuse the drives:

	mount -a

Check the final configuration again:

	df -h

	root@8d1996190b0c:/home/develop# df -h

LDAP Client Configuration  - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol:

Active Directory is hosted by the server. LDAP is the protocol used between
the client and the server.

			ROOT 
			|
		dc=example, dc=com    <-- Domain Component
			|
		--------------------
		ou=user		ou=group  <-- Organization Unit
		  |
		cn=John   <- Common Name


Model an organization:

	Org (root) Acme
		Developer - ou
			Backend  - ou
				person/attribute
					sn=John   <- surname
					Boulder	
					3031234
					----
					cn=John Zip, ou=Backend, ou=Developer, o=Acme
		Business - ou
		Finance - ou
			Accounts - ou
  
groupsOfUniqueName            uniqueMember = cn=John,ou=Backend,o=Acme

	o	organization name
	ou	organization unit
	cn	common name
	sn	surname
	dn	distiguished name
	User	inetOrgPerson		Object
	User	groupsOfUniqueName	Object

With ldif file, run to have it read and applied:

	ldapadd -W -D en=admin,dc=tup,dc=com -f users.ldif

View settings:

	ldapsearch -x -LLL -H ldap:/// -v dc=tup,dc=com

Check that the /etc/hostname contains the fully qualified domain name:

	cat /etc/hostname
	ldapclient.mrh.info

Install LDAP package:

	apt-get -y install libnss-ldapd   -- package for ldap client 

Look at initial configuration:

	vi /etc/nslcd.conf

-----
	# /etc/nslcd.conf
	# nslcd configuration file. See nslcd.conf(5)
	# for details.

	# The user and group nslcd should run as.
	uid nslcd
	gid nslcd

	# The location at which the LDAP server(s) should be reachable.
	#uri ldap://127.0.0.1/

	# The search base that will be used for all queries.
	base dc=mrh,dc=info
	#base dc=example,dc=net

	# The LDAP protocol version to use.
	#ldap_version 3

	# The DN to bind with for normal lookups.
	#binddn cn=annonymous,dc=example,dc=net
	#bindpw secret

	# The DN used for password modifications by root.
	#rootpwmoddn cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com

	# SSL options
	#ssl off
	#tls_reqcert never
	tls_cacertfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

	# The search scope.
	#scope sub

Replace with essentials:

Service running is named "nslcd"

	uid nslcd
	gid nslcd
	uri ldap://127.0.0.1/
	base dc=mrh,dc=info
	tls_cacertfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

	System user and group IDs that run the service "nslcd" identifier.

	Reachable server URI
	uri ldap://ldapserver.mrh.info/

	# The search base that will be used for all queries.
	base dc=mrh,dc=info

Look at current DNS server lookup:

	nslookup <hostname>

	# nslookup e43e9c8e0459
	Server:		192.168.65.5
	Address:	192.168.65.5#53

	** server can't find e43e9c8e0459: NXDOMAIN

Change DNS lookup

	uri ldap://192.168.65.5/

Complete file:

	uid nslcd
	gid nslcd
	uri ldap://192.168.65.5/
	base dc=mrh,dc=info
	tls_cacertfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

Tell Pluggable Auth Module(PAM) to use the LDAP module to create the login.
Request redirects to the LDAP server.

	# pam-auth-update

	# pam-auth-update

	debconf: falling back to frontend: Readline
	PAM configuration
	-----------------

	Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) determine how authentication, authorization, and password changing are
	handled on the system, as well as allowing configuration of additional actions to take when starting user
	sessions.

	Some PAM module packages provide profiles that can be used to automatically adjust the behavior of all
	PAM-using applications on the system.  Please indicate which of these behaviors you wish to enable.

	  1. Unix authentication  3. Create home directory on login       5. none of the above
	  2. LDAP Authentication  4. Inheritable Capabilities Management

	(Enter the items you want to select, separated by spaces.)
