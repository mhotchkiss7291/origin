What is a process ID?
	For every task there is process ID that can be monitored using "top"
	or if you know the name of the application by its process name you can 
	use "ps -ef | grep myname", get the process ID then to kill, "kill -9 PID"

Find what your DNS server is:

cat /etc/resolv.conf

# DNS requests are forwarded to the host. DHCP DNS options are ignored.
nameserver 192.168.65.5

New command: 
	systemd-resolve --status 


Release DHCP server and get a new lease:

	# Release
	sudo dhclient -v -r

	# Get a new lease
	sudo dhclient -v 

Set a static IP address:

	Many different ways that need to be studied.

	
Installing and partitioning a hard drive:

	# What kind of disk to you have?
	sudo fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 80.0 GB, 80026361856 bytes
255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
Disk identifier: 0xf6edf6ed

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda5   *        1960        2661     5638752   83  Linux
/dev/sda6            2662        2904     1951866   83  Linux
/dev/sda7            2905        3147     1951866   83  Linux
/dev/sda8            3148        3264      939771   82  Linux swap / Solaris
/dev/sda9            3265        5283    16217586    b  W95 FAT32

To view all partitions of the /dev/sda hard disk, do the following.

	fdisk -l /dev/sda

Partition table scan:
	MBR:
	BSD: not present
...

	Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

	Command (? for help): d
	Partition number (1-2): 1

Use w to delete partitions....

	Command (? for help): w

	Final checks complete......Overwrite...PARTITIONS!!
	Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): Y

Ready to be partitioned.

	fdisk -l

	Disk identifier: XXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX

Create a GUID Partition Table (GPT)

	sudo gdisk /dev/sda

	? n    - New partition
	? 1    - Partiton number
	Continue if you want more partitions
	? w

	Do you want to proceed? Y

	fdisk -l

	You should see: Disklabel type: gpt

	Device	Start	End	Sectors	Size	Type
	/dev/sda1 2048	xxxxx   xxxxx           Linux filesystem

Create new filesystem:

	sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1   <--------- the partition just created

Prepare to mount the drive:

/etc/fstab lists all of the available disks, partitons, options on separate line.

	# device mounting_directory filesystem_type options dump fsck
	/dev/hdc /cdrom iso9660 rw,noauto,user 0 0

Get the UUID of the disk drive installed:

	sudo blkid     

	Find: UUID=ba15c3ca-06e2-4591-ba49-2230dc3ba3fa

Paste it into the /etc/fstab file

	UUID=ba15c3ca-06e2-4591-ba49-2230dc3ba3fa /mnt/my_mount_pt ext4 defaults 0 0 

Filesystem type: ext4, 0 0 (for whether you want to check on startup)

Create folders for the mount points:

	cd /mnt
	mkdir my_mount_pt

Actually mount the drives listed in the /etc/fstab file

	mount -a

List the disk drives and free space:

	df -h     - Human readable format

To make each of the individual partition be seen as a single file system install:

	apt-get mhddfs 

Edit the /etc/fstab and append this line to "fuse" the partitions

	mhddfs#/mnt/my_mount_pt,/mnt/my_mount_pt2 /mnt/my_system fuse allow_other,nonempty 0 0

Create the directory for mounting:

	cd /mnt
	mkdir my_system

Repeat mount using /etc/fstab to fuse the drives:

	mount -a

Check the final configuration again:

	df -h

	root@8d1996190b0c:/home/develop# df -h
	Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
	overlay          59G   15G   42G  26% /

LDAP Client Configuration: 

Check that the /etc/hostname contains the fully qualified domain name:

	cat /etc/hostname
	ldapclient.mrh.info

Install LDAP package:

	apt-get -y install libnss-ldapd   -- package for ldap client 

Look at initial configuration:

	vi /etc/nslcd.conf

-----
	# /etc/nslcd.conf
	# nslcd configuration file. See nslcd.conf(5)
	# for details.

	# The user and group nslcd should run as.
	uid nslcd
	gid nslcd

	# The location at which the LDAP server(s) should be reachable.
	#uri ldap://127.0.0.1/

	# The search base that will be used for all queries.
	base dc=mrh,dc=info
	#base dc=example,dc=net

	# The LDAP protocol version to use.
	#ldap_version 3

	# The DN to bind with for normal lookups.
	#binddn cn=annonymous,dc=example,dc=net

	#rootpwmoddn cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com

	# SSL options
	#ssl off

	tls_cacertfile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

	# The search scope.
	#scope sub
------

	System user and group IDs that run the service "nslcd" identifier.

	Reachable server URI
	uri ldap://ldapserver.mrh.info/

	# The search base that will be used for all queries.
	base dc=mrh,dc=info

Look at current DNS server lookup:

	nslookup <hostname>

	# nslookup e43e9c8e0459
	Server:		192.168.65.5
	Address:	192.168.65.5#53
