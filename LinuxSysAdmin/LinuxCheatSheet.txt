Explain what makes Linux a secure operating system.
	The concept of a superuser and strict file permissions for execution only 
	by permitted users. Opensource management.

	grep is one of my most useful tools.
	Find a text string inside of a file in the entire filesystem below you:
	find . -type f | xargs grep -i "mystring"

Please elaborate on the effect of multiple desktop environments on a Linux system.
	It may not be a problem for some chosen desktops, but some conflicts 
	can happen with file conventions when two different desktops access
	the same filesystem one after the other. Best to stick with one or what 
	does not cause problems.

Schedule a cron job:

Generate a job for root

	# crontab -e root

Opens in vi, append something like this line that# displays a reminder 
in the user's console window at 4 p.m. on the first and fifteenth of every month.

	0 16 1,15 * * echo Timesheets Due > /dev/console
	
Write and quit and /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root is created:

	# (Cron version -- $Id: crontab.c,v 2.13 1994/01/17 03:20:37 vixie Exp $)
	# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
	#
	# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
	# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
	# and what command to run for the task
	#
	# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
	# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
	# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
	#
	# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
	# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
	#
	# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
	# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
	#
	# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
	# at 5 a.m every week with:

Installing and partitioning a hard drive:

	# What kind of disk to you have?
	sudo fdisk -l

	255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 9729 cylinders
	Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes

	/dev/sda9            3265        5283    16217586    b  W95 FAT32

To view all partitions of the /dev/sda hard disk, do the following.

	fdisk -l /dev/sda

Partition table scan:

	MBR:
	BSD: not present
...

	Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.

	Command (? for help): d
	Partition number (1-2): 1

Use w to delete partitions....

	Command (? for help): w

	Final checks complete......Overwrite...PARTITIONS!!
	Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): Y

Ready to be partitioned.

	fdisk -l

	Disk identifier: XXXXXXX-XXXXX-XXXX

Create a GUID Partition Table (GPT)

	sudo gdisk /dev/sda

	? n    - New partition
	? 1    - Partiton number
	Continue if you want more partitions
	? w

	Do you want to proceed? Y

	fdisk -l

	You should see: Disklabel type: gpt

	Device	Start	End	Sectors	Size	Type
	/dev/sda1 2048	xxxxx   xxxxx           Linux filesystem

Create new filesystem:

	sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1   <--------- the partition just created

Prepare to mount the drive:

/etc/fstab lists all of the available disks, partitons, options on separate line.

	# device mounting_directory filesystem_type options dump fsck
	/dev/hdc /cdrom iso9660 rw,noauto,user 0 0

Get the UUID of the disk drive installed:

	sudo blkid     

	Find: UUID=ba15c3ca-06e2-4591-ba49-2230dc3ba3fa

Paste it into the /etc/fstab file

	UUID=ba15c3ca-06e2-4591-ba49-2230dc3ba3fa /mnt/my_mount_pt ext4 defaults 0 0 

Filesystem type: ext4, 0 0 (for whether you want to check on startup)

Create folders for the mount points:

	cd /mnt
	mkdir my_mount_pt

Actually mount the drives listed in the /etc/fstab file

	mount -a

List the disk drives and free space:

	df -h     - Human readable format

To make each of the individual partition be seen as a single file system install:

	apt-get mhddfs 

Edit the /etc/fstab and append this line to "fuse" the partitions

	mhddfs#/mnt/my_mount_pt,/mnt/my_mount_pt2 /mnt/my_system fuse allow_other,nonempty 0 0

Create the directory for mounting:

	cd /mnt
	mkdir my_system

Repeat mount using /etc/fstab to fuse the drives:

	mount -a

Check the final configuration again:

	df -h

	root@8d1996190b0c:/home/develop# df -h
	Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on

LDAP Client Configuration  - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol:

Active Directory is hosted by the server. LDAP is the protocol used between
the client and the server.

			ROOT 
			|
		dc=example, dc=com    <-- Domain Component
			|
		--------------------
		ou=user		ou=group  <-- Organization Unit
		  |
		cn=John   <- Common Name


Model an organization:

	Org (root) Acme
		Developer - ou
			Backend  - ou
				person/attribute
					sn=John   <- surname
					Boulder	
					3031234
					----
					cn=John Zip, ou=Backend, ou=Developer, o=Acme
		Business - ou
		Finance - ou
			Accounts - ou
  
groupsOfUniqueName            uniqueMember = cn=John,ou=Backend,o=Acme

	o	organization name
	ou	organization unit
	cn	common name
	sn	surname
	dn	distiguished name
	User	inetOrgPerson		Object
	User	groupsOfUniqueName	Object

Check that the /etc/hostname contains the fully qualified domain name:

	cat /etc/hostname
	ldapclient.mrh.info

Look at current DNS server lookup:

	nslookup <hostname>

	# nslookup e43e9c8e0459
	Server:		192.168.65.5
	Address:	192.168.65.5#53
